# Capstone proposal

The goal of arrow_capstone_project is to ...

## Summary 
improve user and developer experience, 

by: allowing them to use namespacing, supply their own function, access documentation for existing bindings, improved error messaging. 

## Scope

Jira tickets:

* [ARROW-14575](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14575) 
  - allow bindings to use the `pkg::` prefixes
  - I have done some work on this, but I thought Iâ€™d add it to the list since it adds important functionality and will also enable other tickets (such as 3). 
  - The design I opted for, so far, was to register bindings twice, once with the name and once with the namespace (`pkg::`) prefix.
  - There are still some edge cases that need to be sorted, such as some of the unary functions (which are defined as a list which is used for several purposes)
  - Definition of done: users being able to use a namespaced version of all our bindings, making, for example, the following snippet of code work:
```r
nycflights13::flights %>% 
  arrow_table() %>% 
  mutate(year = lubridate::year(time_hour)) %>% 
  collect()
```


https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14071 - allow users to arrow_eval a function
Steps: 
Translate the user-defined function with the help of bindings
Give users access to existing bindings
Translate user defined functions with the help of the existing bindings
A second step might be accessing / registering these functions
Where is the function? Global environment, other script that is being sourced or a package
If registering is required, order of namespace loading / attaching might be important
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15011 - (semi) automatically document a binding
Solving ticket 1 might prove very useful for this one
This will allow us to document differences in behaviours, unsupported arguments, etc.
I think this could be really useful for users (?). How would the access said documentation?
Steps: 


https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13370 - more special handling for known errors in arrow_eval
This could be related to 3 since we could opt for custom error messages when an argument is not supported, for example
We could also warn when there is a difference between the binding and the original function (e.g. different default values, slight differences in implementation, etc.)
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15016 - show_query() for arrow_dplyr_query 


https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12322 - work around masking of data type functions
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14855 - build_expr() should check that non-expression inputs have vec_size() == 1L
This is a bit of an extra ticket, not strictly related to the ones above.
